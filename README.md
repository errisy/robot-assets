robot test

This is second time doing a "Robot Test". An Angular 2 UI with Animation playground was developed.

One key feature of the async animation technology is the cancellable Task.

In the async/await world, a async task shall not be just a "method", it should be managable instance. When another event from UI is fired, we should have a proper way to stop the async method (especially for animation and front end routing).
